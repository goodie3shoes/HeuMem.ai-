### 📘 About
**HeuMem.ai** (short for *Heuristic Memory Loop*) explores how principles from psychiatry—mentalization, affect regulation, and cognitive stability—can inform safer, empathic AI design.  
The goal is to model *how minds connect, remember, and understand each other*—so that artificial intelligence learns to care, not just compute.

### 🧩 Core Ideas
- Emotional-cognitive modeling inspired by psychiatric frameworks  
- Contextual memory design for human-AI mutual understanding  
- Research prototypes for empathy evaluation and trust calibration  
- Foundation for **Human Memory Markup Language (HML)**
